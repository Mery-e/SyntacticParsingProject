Classifiers
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
The SVM classifier is implemented using scikit-learn's SVC class with a linear kernel. Training and testing data are loaded from the pickle files, preprocessed, and fed into the classifier.

Decision Tree
A Decision Tree classifier is trained and tested using scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier. The default settings are used for this classifier.

Random Forest
The Random Forest classifier is implemented using scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier. It consists of an ensemble of decision trees and is trained on the dataset to perform classification.

Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is applied using scikit-learn's LogisticRegression class. It's a linear model suitable for binary classification tasks.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The KNN classifier is implemented using scikit-learn's KNeighborsClassifier. It classifies samples based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors.

Model Comparisons
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed for each classifier. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are also generated to visualize the performance.

Artificial Neural Network
An artificial neural network (ANN) model is built using Keras. It consists of multiple layers with dropout regularization and sigmoid activation functions. The model is trained using the training data and evaluated on the test data.
